# Mobile First Website

My second project for the Treehouse Front-End Development Techdegree (see [here](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/front-end-web-development-techdegree/)).



## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS



## Description

This is another sample profile website, but this time with a focus on mobile-first design. All CSS styles were created for mobile devices first, and then progressively for larger screen sizes. There is also a lot of floated elements (on purpose), even though "floats" are out of style...there is still a purpose for floated elements!
